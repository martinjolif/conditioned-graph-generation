# ALTEGRAD project

run `python main.py` to execute the model with the default properties extraction (numbers extraction in the text graph description)

run ` python main.py --text-embedding-method "clip_text_encoder" --n-condition 512` to execute the model with an embedding of the graph text description done with a clip text encoder (512 is the dimension of the text embedding).
